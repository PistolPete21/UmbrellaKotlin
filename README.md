# Umbrella App - Kotlin

This project was a challenege project by The Nerdery that was based around using the DarkSky Api to create a fully functional weather application that gave the forecast for today and tomorrow.

## Getting Started

To install the project simply download the repo and install on an emulator. Make sure to replace the api key in gradle.properties with your very own DarkSky Api key.

```
